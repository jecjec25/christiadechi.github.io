            <h2>READING BOOKS</h2>
            <h3>"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. A man who never read lives only one."</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Imagination is our limit. We will find everything when we are reading. Books can take us everywhere.
                We can be powerful by reading a book. There are plenty of books around the world. Read until you can
                because it is also a key to be successful in life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Reading is always going to be important because it helps our brain to develop, gives us non-stop knowledge
                and lessons while keeping our minds active. When we are reading books, it helps us to learn and we can't be
                underestimated, because we can acquire vocabulary words that is new to us and we develop thinking skills.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Reading can also relieve stress. Read something you know you'll love it. Live in someone else life. Be inside
                the book. As you can see, reading was quite good for you.

                to get inspired by watching her favorite TV shows and dreaming about becoming famous. It inspired her to write

                people. Plus, we have the same zodiac sign because we are both born on the month of December. Because of her, I got 
                addicted in music. I get inspired to sing. It let my feelings out by singing. And also watching hollywood movies makes
                me fluent in english. It was all because of her. Taylor Swift was my inspiration eversince.

            <h2>"A Furious Cat named Tiger"</h2>
            <h3>I compare myself to a cat as my representation</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have a cat named Tiger. I named him like that because of the color of his fur. Both of us
                love to sleep. I don't know what his reason is but my personal reason is that it helps me to
                escape the reality. I know it hurts so much that life will drag me to the bottom. Reality 
                will make us face hardships in life. But with the help of my family and my furry friend beside me,
                everything will be just fine. Tiger's favorite food is fish either cook or not while mine is fried
                chicken. We are contended for what we received. What people should know about us is how can them be
                close to us. Simply the answer is to treat us special. We need more kindness and love more than others
                because we are sensitive. Plus, we only choose people that we like. Tiger and I don't much like
                hugs and kisses. We get cringe by just touching us. But if people try to get our attention and makes 
                effort to get our attention, it can bring us happiness because for that we know that we our valued.
                Did you know that a person and a cat have a common to one another? Well, my cat and I have anxiety towards
                other people. Our heart is beating so fast that we can have racing competion and see who's heart is running
                fast. Like my cat, curiosity will also kill me. We accept challenges and fight until we win I guess.
